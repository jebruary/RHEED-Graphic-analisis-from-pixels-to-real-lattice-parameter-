# RHEED-Graphic-analisis-from-pixels-to-real-lattice-parameter-
Firstly you must have 2 pictures which are before annealing and after annealing, which the code will request. 

Secondly you must have the reciprocal lattice parameter which the code will ask you for.

Then by pointing out the 2 points in both pictures, it calculates the distance them, in unit of pixels.

ATTENTION the equation used in this code is for hexagon pattern sample, if you wish to use for other patterns, you could change the equation of line 109.
